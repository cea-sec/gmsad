# gmsad

`gmsad` manages Active Directory group Managed Service Account (gMSA) on Linux.

Given the keytab of an account which has the ability to retrieve the secret of a gMSA, `gmsad` creates a keytab for the service account and renew it when necessary. It can execute an arbitrary command just after renewing the keytab.

# Requirements

Your Active Directory domain must be able to use group Managed Service Account which implies :
* AD schema updated to Windows Server 2012 ([Getting Started with Group Managed Service Accounts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts))
* KDS Root Key deployed ([Create the Key Distribution Services KDS Root Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/create-the-key-distribution-services-kds-root-key))
